Message: What is artificial intelligence
Response: What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables machines to perform intelligent tasks, such as learning and reasoning, without human intervention. AI systems can analyze data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and even interact with humans, relying on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning. From basic applications, such as voice recognition and language translation, to more complex applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics, AI is transforming the way we live and interact with technology.

Response: What is mmachine learning and howDoes it differFrom traditional statistical approaches?

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that can learn and improve their performance based on data, without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can identify patterns, classify data, make predictions, and automate decision-making processes. These models are trained on large datasets and can learn to adapt to new information, making them particularly useful in handling complex and dynamic data.
